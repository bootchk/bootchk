I am an infrequent contributor to [GIMP](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp)
mainly in the plugin machinery (ScriptFu and Python and GObject Introspection.)
Several of my repositories test GIMP plugin machinery.

I am the maintainer for the [Resynthesizer plugin for GIMP](https://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer).
Also see [resynthesizerJulia](https://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizerJulia), elucidating and generalizing the algorithm to many dimensions.

I have a masters degree in computer science and have worked in industry.

I also make electronics.  I create solar-powered, Calder art mobiles and chimes.  See my [online gallery](https://bootchk.github.io/solabile)

I also am proficient in embedded systems, mostly ultra-low power systems and networks, i.e. IOT.
Some repositories are for Nordic radios, Bluetooth, Texas Instrument MSP430, and energy harvesting chips.
